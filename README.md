# Dragster
This project is for our robot called the Dragster. It resembles a simple VEXcode Pro C++ project. 
The DriveTrain file holds the class for the drive train, which contains the initializations of the motors for the drivetrain. It also includes the code
for the forwards, backwards, and the stopping functions of the robot. In the class, there are also functions to return the temperature of the motors
in case problems arise and the temperature of the motors are too high. The main.cpp file contains the simple TeleOp program to control the robot with the VEX V5 Controller.
The robot_config file is for assigning all of the motors, sensors and other devices to the Dragster. Finally, the vex.h file is required for all VexCode projects.
